## Usage Instructions

### Applying Enhancements to Existing Characters

1. **Add CharacterRealisticEnhancer Component**:
   ```csharp
   // Add to any existing character GameObject
   var enhancer = character.AddComponent<CharacterRealisticEnhancer>();
   enhancer.targetArchetype = CharacterArchetype.Protagonist;
   enhancer.realisticSkinMaterial = skinMaterial;
   enhancer.realisticHairMaterial = hairMaterial;
   ```

2. **Configure Enhancement Settings**:
   - Enable desired enhancements (mesh subdivision, blend shapes, etc.)
   - Set archetype-specific properties
   - Assign realistic materials

3. **Run Enhancement Process**:
   - Call `EnhanceCharacter()` method or use context menu
   - System automatically applies all selected enhancements

### Creating New Realistic Characters

1. **Use ProceduralCharacterMeshGenerator**:
   ```csharp
   var generator = character.AddComponent<ProceduralCharacterMeshGenerator>();
   generator.archetype = CharacterArchetype.Fashionista;
   generator.heightMultiplier = 1.05f;
   generator.shoulderWidth = 0.95f;
   generator.GenerateCharacterMesh();
   ```

2. **Apply Realistic Controller**:
   ```csharp
   var controller = character.AddComponent<RealisticCharacterController>();
   controller.realisticSkinMaterial = skinMaterial;
   controller.enableSubsurfaceScattering = true;
   ```
